          The <strong>SMART Maker Festival 2025</strong> is a non-profit,
          family-friendly celebration of creativity, innovation, and hands-on
          invention. Since its Indian debut in 2019, SMF has grown into one of
          the most dynamic gatherings of tech enthusiasts, artists, scientists,
          and makers. SMF 2020 and 2021 saw a digital transformation amid global
          challenges, hosting virtual showcases and workshops. In 2022, the
          festival made a hybrid comeback, reigniting the spirit of innovation.
          SMF 2023 expanded its reach with greater participation, while SMF
          2024 was a record-breaking event in Kolkata, drawing thousands to
          celebrate science, art, and technology. Now, <strong>SMART Maker Festival 2025</strong> returns
          grander than ever with science exhibitions, innovative project
          competitions, quizzes, photography and filmmaking contests, food
          stalls, handicrafts, and expert panel discussions. It continues to be
          a platform for showcasing ideas, learning, and collaboration.{" "}

          <strong>"THE ANTICIPATION ENDS HERE!!!"</strong> â€” the SMART Maker
          Festival 2025 is back to empower the creators of tomorrow.
